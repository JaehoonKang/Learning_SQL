## Entity Relationship Diagrams
<br>

An `entity relationship diagram (ERD)` is a common way to view data in a database. Below is the `ERD` for the database we will use from Parch & Posey. These diagrams help you visualize the data you are analyzing including:

- The names of the tables.
- The columns in each table.
- The way the tables work together.

Here is an example of Data table (intertwined)

### Structured Query Language (SQL) queries

- SQL is easy to understand.
- Traditional databases allow us to access data directly.
- Traditional databases allow us to audit and replicate our data.
- SQL is a great tool for analyzing multiple tables at once.
- SQL allows you to analyze more complex questions than dashboard tools like Google Analytics.


#### What is NoSQL?

- `NoSQL` environments tend to be particularly popular for web based data (`MongoDB`)

#### Why Businesses Like Databases

1. Data integrity is ensured - only the data you want entered is entered, and only certain users are able to enter data into the database. 


2. Data can be accessed quickly - SQL allows you to obtain results very quickly from the data stored in a database. Code can be optimized to quickly pull results. 


3. Data is easily shared - multiple individuals can access data stored in a database, and the data is the same for all users allowing for consistent results for anyone with access to your database.


#### Statements

1. `CREATE` TABLE is a statement that creates a new table in a database.
2. `DROP` TABLE is a statement that removes a table in a database.
3. `SELECT` allows you to read data and display it. This is called a `query`


##### SQL Command

1. `SELECT` indicates which column(s) you want to be given the data for.

2. `FROM` specifies from which table(s) you want to select the columns.

- `SELECT * FROM orders`

- Every query will have at least a `SELECT` and `FROM` statement. The `SELECT` statement is where you put the columns for which you would like to show the data. The `FROM` statement is where you put the tables from which you would like to pull data. 


##### Coding Convention

- SQL is not case or space sensitive. However, it is highly encouraged that the following styles would be kept.


```sql
SELECT id, date
FROM accounts
LIMIT 15
ORDER BY ocurred_at
```
